<p>I often need to make a note of something when browsing the web and, since my current web browser of choice is Chromium, I have been looking for a suitable extension. I soon discovered Scratchpad, an extension developed by Google. It allows you to keep free-format text notes which are stored locally and, if you choose, synchronise them with a Google Docs account. This looked to do what I wanted but after a little testing I found it annoying because when you click on the extension's icon it appears in a small window in the top right-hand corner of the browser's window. I also found that items I was deleting via the extension were not being deleted from my Google Docs account.<br/><br/>I then started using an extension called Quick Note which offered much the same functionality but synchronised with Diigo, not Google Docs. Later I stumbled across a <a href="http://wandersick.blogspot.com/2011/03/10-tips-for-utilizing-scratchpad-of.html" target="_self">blog post</a> which revived my interest in Scratchpad because it showed a simple method of having it open in a full tab instead of a tiny window. Since I discovered this tip I have again switched my storage of online and offline notes back to Scratchpad from Quick Note.<br/><br/>Since I plan to store all sorts of information (some would say "rubbish" :P ) via Scratchpad, having a full-content search capability would be useful. The above blog post also listed a solution to this, with Google Docs is used as a custom search engine solely for documents stored via Scratchpad.<br/><br/>At least for the moment I'm very happy with Scratchpad and so will continue to use it. Keep an eye on my blog though, in case I find something I like more. :P</p>
