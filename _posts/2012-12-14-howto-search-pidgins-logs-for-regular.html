I wanted to search all of Pidgin's logs for mention of a subject I remembered was discussed a few months ago.<br /><br />From within the directory for Pidgin's log files - ~/.purple - I tried the following command:<br /><br />grep -R &lt;regex&gt; *.txt"<br /><br />Sadly this failed miserably so I asked for help. Immediately someone came up with the answer:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">grep -R &lt;regex&gt; **/*.txt</span>
