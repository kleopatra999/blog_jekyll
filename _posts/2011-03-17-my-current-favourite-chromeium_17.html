<p>&nbsp;<br/><br/>Here are the Chrom(e|ium) extensions and apps which I am currently using and the purpose for which I have them installed. This list may not be of use to anyone else but at least if I lose all my extensions I know where to get a list of those I did have installed. :)<br/><br/>I'm trying to keep the list of extensions to a minimum because I know they use memory all the time they're running.<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><strong>Extensions</strong><br/><br/>Scribefire - blog entry writing, which allows for writing entries offline. Since I usually think of stuff I want to blog about while offline, this was an important feature.<br/><br/>App Launcher - provides an icon in the top bar from which I can choose an installed application.<br/><br/>Adblock PLus for Google Chrome - blocks ads. :) I'm still not sure if this is worth having installed but I'll wait and see.<br/><br/>Diigo Bookmark etc... - to bookmark pages of interest. I am experimenting with this extension as a way of bookmarking and storing web pages which I want to read later.<br/><br/>Google Tasks - provides a full-window view of tasks in Google Tasks.<br/><br/>Quickrr World Clock - displays the current time in whatever locations around the world you choose. I use this when chatting in IRC and want to know the local time elsewhere.<br/><br/>RSS Subscription Extension - I use this to subscribe quickly and easly to RSS feeds.<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><strong>Apps</strong><br/><br/>imo - This is basically a link to the imo chat web site which provides a web interface to multiple instant messaging networks.<br/><br/>Quick Note - allows you to store text and images both locally and synchronise with your personal Diigo "library". I am testing this as a way of making notes about stuff that I need to have access to offline.<br/><br/>&nbsp;</p>
