<strong>Note:</strong> This tip was presented by the <a title="Web Upd8" href="http://www.webupd8.org/2011/05/how-to-remove-maximized-windows.html" target="_blank">Web Upd8</a> site but I wanted to mention it here in case people hadn't already seen it there.<br/><br/>In a standard GNOME 3 windows have a titlebar which contains only the window's title and a close button. To maximise the amount of vertical space available, the tip presented on the Web Upd8 site changes the theme so that maximised windows no longer have a title bar. Since the name of the application also appears in the panel at the top of the screen, there's no information lost there. And even though the close button is no longer visible, you can easily access the window controls menu by pressing [Alt] + [Space].<br/><br/>If you have a netbook or simply want a little extra vertical space, try this tip for yourself.
