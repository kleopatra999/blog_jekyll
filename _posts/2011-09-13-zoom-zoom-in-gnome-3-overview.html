<p>When you press the Windows (AKA "Super") key, GNOME presents the Overview, a thumbnail view of all the open windows. By accident I discovered that if you hover the mosue cursor over any of the thumbnails and move the mouse's scroll button, you can zoom in and out the thumbnail. I'm not sure in what version of GNOME 3 this was introduced, nor what you would use it for my I thought I would mention it here anyway. :D</p>
