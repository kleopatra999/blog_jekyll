I recently bought a USB "key" (as they're commonly known here in Australia) which was essentially just the chip wrapped in plastic. It's so small that I'm almost certain to lose it at some point :). I also recently installed my first live Linux installation on a USB key. Live Linux installations are nothing new, and nor are small USB keys. Put the two together, though, and I think they're quite amazing. Imagine I need to run my favourite OS on a foreign PC. I don't need to carry a key in on my belt or hanging from a lanyard, I just need to open my wallet and there it is!<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><div><img src="http://www.verbatim.com.au/images/products/large/44050-1.jpg" alt="Store'n' Go Micro USB Drive Black 16GB" /></div><br/>&nbsp;<br/><div>Although I have worked in IT for many years, I'm still often amazed at some of the things that technology makes possible.</div><br/>&nbsp;<br/><div>Rock on!</div>
