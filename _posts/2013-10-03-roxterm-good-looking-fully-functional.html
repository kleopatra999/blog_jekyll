Since the GNOME developers recently dropped transparency from the native terminal emulator application, you might be looking for an alternative. There are many available, but I would recommend you consider ROXTerm [1]. It's effectively a drop-in replacement for the GNOME Terminal application. Its features include: drag-and-drop support for files, a tabbed interface, the ability to drag tabs outside the main window to create separate windows, and extensive configuration options.
