I <strong>wish</strong> I had more time to devote to FLOSS activities, including writing the newsletter for Frugalware Linux.  I am really frustrated when "real life" stops me from spending the little spare time I want to devote to FLOSS.  In a week I usually have about 6-7 hours at home in which I can work on FLOSS.  There's not a lot I can do in that time, but I can usually get a few things on my "To Do" list either completed or progressed.<br/><br/>When something happens at home, though, any time I would have spent on the PC is lost.  I'm sure I'm not addicted ( :) ), it's just that I'd like to make a difference, faster than I can at the moment.  I recently asked some people if they'd like to be cloned, and a surprising number of people thought it was a good idea, allowing the "other" them to do the boring stuff in life.  It's not just me, then, that wishes they had more spare time for FLOSS.
