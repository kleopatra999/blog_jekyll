<b>Link2SD</b><br /><br /><b>Category</b>: Utility<br /><b>Cost</b>: Free<br /><b>Requires root access?</b>: Yes<br /><br />I have decided to highlight Android applications I think are useful, interesting or fun. First on the list is Link2SD.<br /><br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buak.Link2SD&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5idWFrLkxpbmsyU0QiXQ..">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buak.Link2SD&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5idWFrLkxpbmsyU0QiXQ..</a><br /><br />Its main goal is to alleviate the problem of limited internal storage of an Android phone by allowing you to move user applications and their data to a micro SD card. Although there are several scripts to do the same for custom ROMs, they can be very ROM-specific and Link2SD is easy to use and has wider ROM compatibility. Link2SD's features also include the ability to freeze apps and automatically move them to SD storage.<br /><br />If you find the internal storage of your phone is getting low, try Link2SD.
