Firefox offers a handy built-in Javascript editor named 'Scratchpad' which can act as a basic text editor. It's great for small text editing needs, including your TODO list, or perhaps making quick notes about something you just read about. Multiple instances of Scratchpad can be open at once, and they are seen by a window manager as seperate windows.  Scratchpad's features include: * Keyboard shortcuts; * 'Recent files' menu; * Basic editing, including undo, redo, find, and jump (to a specific line number).  There is no search-and-replace function because it's outside Scratchpad's design scope.  Next time you need to do some basic editing, try Scratchpad instead of your usual editor.
