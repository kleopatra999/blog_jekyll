I am impressed by recent changes and changes in progress to Firefox, namely:<br /><br /><ul><li>an optional PDF viewer written in Javascript;</li><li>a new Downloads dialog box, with a matching Navigation bar button to  show/hide the dialog. I definitely prefer this to having an entirely  separate window opened (available only in the Nightly build at the  moment); </li><li>an option to open links in a Private Window. This is an improvement over  the previous option, which was to switch the entire browser into  Private Browsing mode (OK - I may have the name of that feature wrong)  (available only in the Nightly build at the  moment).</li></ul>Yay Mozilla!<br /><br /><b>Note</b>: I am well aware that these features have been available in Chrome for some time. I give Google credit for the excellent browser that is Chrome but my preference is for Firefox.
