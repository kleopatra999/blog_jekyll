Being new to OSX and my iMac, I couldn't understand why writing an ISO image to a USB thumb drive was very slow, sometimes taking around 2 hours. Having done the same under Linux I *knew* it wasn't supposed to take that long. Finally I searched for and found the solution in a superuser entry [1], I found a solution: prefix the device name with "r". I also learned that the block size parameter must be specified in lower case on OSX: "bs=1M" instead of "bs=1M" under Linux.  WARNING: The device parameters I have used in the following examples may not match the device parameters required in your configuration. *DO NOT* simply copy-and-paste these commands.  For example, the following is a command I might use under Linux:  <blockquote>dd if=filename.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M</blockquote> The equivalent command on OSX would be:  <blockquote>dd if=filename.iso of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m</blockquote> Note the "r" in the output device's name, also that the "m" is in lower case.
