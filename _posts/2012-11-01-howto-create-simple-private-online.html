TL;DR I can recommend <a href="http://www.photoswipe.com/" title="PhotoSwipe">PhotoSwipe</a> to anyone who needs to create an online photo slideshow on their own web host.<br />I was recently asked to create an online photo slideshow. Despite being web savvy, I had never done anything like this so I asked my colleagues for suggestions. As a result I used <a href="http://www.photoswipe.com/" title="PhotoSwipe">PhotoSwipe</a>, and found it was incredibly easy to get working. All I needed was a web host and access to upload the files which made up the slideshow application.<br />The steps required were:<br /><ol><li>Download PhotoSwipe;</li><li>Extract the contents of the PhotoSwipe zip file;</li><li>Upload PhotoSwipe to a folder on the web host;</li><li>Edit the index.html with the names of the images and configuration options;</li><li>Upload the images.</li></ol>Other hosted options such as Dropbox's native slideshow option would have achieved a similar result but in my case I needed to keep the slideshow private.
