Frugalware Linux has seen several new developers join the team in recent months.  Most of those have been French.  Now let me first say that there's nothing wrong with being French!<br/><br/>It seems that these same people have been encouraged to join the development team by an existing, French developer - Devil505.  This leads me to the thought - is it possible that these people are in fact Devil505, but by different names?  :P
