<p>Firefox allows you to assign keyboard shortcuts to search engines, allowing you to conduct searches from within the address bar. Assigning the shortcut "G" to Google for example, allows you to do a Google search in the address bar. If you're searching for references to Halle Berry, you could type 'g "halle berry"' into the address bar.&nbsp;<p /> When I discovered this I was left thinking "Why do I leave the search bar displayed, when I am now using the address bar to search?" To remove it I simply right clicked on the toolbar containing the search bar and from within the dialog, removed the search bar. Voila! I now have a cleaner-looking Firefox without missing any functionality.</p>
