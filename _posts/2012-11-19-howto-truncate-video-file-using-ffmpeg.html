I had a video file from which I needed to cut the end off from a specific point. I didn't want to use a video editor since it seemed a simple enough task, so I went look for alternate solutions.<br /><br />The following page gave me a solution using <b>ffmpeg</b>:<br /><a href="http://quickhowto.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/how-to-truncate-video-using-command.html">http://quickhowto.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/how-to-truncate-video-using-command.html</a><br /><br />ffmpeg -vcodec copy -acodec copy -i  [inputfile] -ss [start] -t [duration] [outputfile]<br /><br />My first attempt failed because I specified a duration of 36 seconds and I wanted 36 minutes. Reading ffmpeg's man page confirmed that the duration needs to be specified in the format <i>hh:mm:ss</i>. In my case I needed "00:36:00".
