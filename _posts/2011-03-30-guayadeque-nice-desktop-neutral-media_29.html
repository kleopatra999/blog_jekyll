I have been searching for an audio player which can take the place of Rhythmbox, because I switch between the GNOME and Xfce desktop environments. My main problem has been that I don't know what I am looking for, only what I <strong>don't</strong> want. :( I have tried all of the GUI audio media players available in the Frugalware repositories. After a long search I am currently using Guayadeque -Â <a href="http://guayadeque.org/">http://guayadeque.org</a>. It's quite light on dependencies but is very full featured, including support for:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Cross-fade</li><br/>	<li>Lyrics</li><br/>	<li>Downloading album artwork</li><br/>	<li>Audio</li><br/>	<li>Podcasts</li><br/>	<li>Recording</li><br/></ul><br/><img src="http://phayz.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/guayadeque_music_player1.png" alt="Screenshot of Guayadeque audio player" width="600" height="340" /><br/><br/>I may not use an audio player like most people because I usually listen to just one album at a time. Guayadeque suits me but I can't explain just why I like it. Just as different text editors suit different people, the same applies to audio media players. I am beginning to understand just why there are so many media players available on Linux:<strong> not everyone's the same.</strong> The only thing I now need to do is find an application which allows me to rip tracks from a CD into my preferred format. I'm thinking that a console-based application would be best. When I find one I like I'll report back here.<br/><br/>For the moment, keep on rocking!
