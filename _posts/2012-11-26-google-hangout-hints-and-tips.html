<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>Google Hangouts are a free service provided by Google, which allow for video chats between up to 10 people. <br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>To participate in a Hangout only requires a modern PC web browser, or an Android phone with the Google Plus app installed. <br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><h2 id="Installing_the_required_bits_and_pieces">Installing the required bits and pieces</h2>When you participate in a Hangout for the first time, the required plug-ins will be installed. <br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>It  is therefore recommended to attend a "fake hangout" with a friend  before your maiden Google Hangout so the appropriate plug-ins are  installed ahead of time.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>On  Linux, you will be asked to add a new repository, and may also need to  perform an update after the repository is installed before you can  install the plug-ins.<br /><h3 id="MicrophoneHeadset">Microphone/Headset</h3>If  you are using the Gnome 3 desktop environment, setting your USB headset  or microphone as the default device can sometimes be difficult.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>Using Gnome 3 extensions will help you immensely to ensure your headset or microphone is the primary device during a Google Hangout.<br /><h3 id="Installing_the_Pulse_Audio_Shortcuts_Extension">Installing the Pulse Audio Shortcuts Extension</h3><ol><li>Visit <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/109/pulse-audio-shortcuts/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/109/pulse-audio-shortcuts/</a></li><li>Install the Extension.</li><li>Install the suggested packages in the description of the extension (not doing this will make the extesion useless).</li><li>If the extension does not appear in the task bar, restart your Gnome 3 session <br />Alt+F2, then type restart or r.</li><li>Plug in your USB headset or mic.</li></ol><h3 id="Setting_your_inputoutput_device">Setting your input/output device</h3><ol><li>Open the Volume Control menu in the task bar.</li><li>Select Pulse Audio Shortcuts, and then click Volume Control.</li><li>Click Volume Control.</li><li>In the volume control window, select Configuraton.<br />Your Internal Audio and &lt;Headset/Mic Name&gt; will display.</li><li>Select the "OFF" profile for the Internal Audio device.</li><li>The USB headset is now the only device that will playback and send audio on your PC.</li></ol><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>When  you have completed the Google Hangout, unplug your USB device, and  reverse the configuration in the Setting your input/output device  procedure.<br /><br /><h2>Hints and Tips </h2><h3 id="Wired_vs_Wireless">Wired vs Wireless</h3>If possible, use a wired network connection because you're likely to get better video quality.<br /><br /><h3><b>Testing... testing... Is this thing on?</b></h3>Since a Google Hangout uses both audio and video sources, you need to check the audio settings of your desktop environment (DE) <b>AND</b> those of the Google Hangout.<br /><ol><li>Before  starting the Hangout, check your DE's audio setting, making sure that  the volume settings are OK and that your microphone is on;</li><li>Once the Hangout is started, click on the Settings icon and again confirm that your microphone is on.</li></ol><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>Forgetting to do both these checks may result in an award-winning Marcel Marceau impression.<br /><h3 id="Add_your_national_flag_and_screen_name_to_your_hangout_window">Add your national flag and screen name to your Hangout window</h3>When  you start a Hangout, there are many add-ons (called Apps) that will  enhance your experience, particulary when talking with international  folk, or in a full room.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>Once  such add on is "Hangout Toolbox". This app will superimpose your name  (of your choosing) and your national flag as a "lower third" of your  hangout view window.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>This makes it really easy to work out who is speaking, and what their name is.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><ol><li>In a hangout session, select Add Apps from the left hand list.</li><li>From the list of available apps, select Hangout Toolbox and install.</li><li>Hangout Toolbox will display in your left pane apps list.</li><li>Click to open the menu.</li><li>The first menu is the "lower third" menu.</li><li>Set the following<ol><li>User Name</li><li>Role (in the second field)</li><li>Select Country (your flag)</li><li>Set the slider to ON.<h2 id="Talk_to_the_camera_not_the_screen">Talk to the camera, not the screen</h2></li></ol></li><li>The configured options will display the info like you see in news broadcasts. Very cool.</li></ol><h3 id="Use_Events_to_make_fancy_meeting_invitations">Use Events to make fancy meeting invitations</h3>Google Plus has an Events tab, and it is simply awesome for making meeting invites for work meetings.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>You  can create an event, and invite people you know on G+ directly. If the  invitees accept the meeting, it will appear in their Google calendar as  an appointment, and will remind them to attend.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>When the user visits G+ to join the hangout, a "join now" button displays at the event start time.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><img height="16px" src="https://docspace.corp.redhat.com/4.5.7/images/emoticons/info.gif" width="16px" /><b>Note</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you are the organizer, you can not start the Hangout earlier from  the invite. You must wait until the start time ticks over before you can  launch the Hangout. Otherwise you get an "Untitled" hangout, which none  of the other participants will know about.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><h3 id="Talk_to_the_camera_not_the_screen">Talk to the camera, not the screen</h3>When  you are the one talking in a Hangout, it is natural to want to talk to  the person you see on the screen. This has a weird side-effect: you  appear to be looking "somewhere else", not at the person.<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>Take a leaf out of broadcast television: the camera is the audience. Talk to the camera and engage your participants.
